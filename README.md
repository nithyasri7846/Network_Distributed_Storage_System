# Network Distributed Storage System using GlusterFS 🚀

This project implements a **fault-tolerant, replicated, and distributed file system** using **GlusterFS** across multiple nodes. It ensures **data replication, consistency, and high availability**.

## 🔹 Features
✅ Distributed and Replicated Storage  
✅ Fault Tolerance across Nodes
✅ Consistency among the Nodes


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **GlusterFS** for distributed storage  
- **Ubuntu/Linux** as the operating system  
- **Python/Bash** for automation scripts
